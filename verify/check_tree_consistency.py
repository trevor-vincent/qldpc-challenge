"""Refuse artifacts whose board entry does not exist.

Every artifact this board keeps is filed under the slug of the entry it
belongs to: `codes/<slug>.json` is the entry, `notes/<slug>.md` explains how it
was found, `certs/<slug>.json` certifies its distance,
`certs/heuristic/<slug>.json` records an uncertified one, `circuits/<slug>/`
holds its syndrome-extraction experiments, and `receipts/ler/<slug>.json`
records a post-merge rate replication. Remove or rename the entry and each of
those becomes orphaned.

That is not hypothetical. Until this check existed, nothing resolved an
artifact's slug back to `codes/`:

  * 38 notes were left behind by the removals of 2026-09-11 and by distance
    revisions that wrote a new note under the new slug instead of renaming the
    one they had. `site/build.py` resolves a note by slug from an *existing*
    entry, so every one of them rendered nowhere: invisible in production,
    invisible to readers, and invisible to CI.
  * 21 certificates were left behind by the same removals. `check_certs.py`
    validates a certificate's schema, evidence rules and binding hash but never
    asks whether the entry it binds to is still there, so
    `ok: 750 certificates valid` was true with 21 of those 750 attesting to a
    file that is not in the repository.

Both were silent because `check_prose.py` inspects only files a PR *changes*.
An orphan is not a change: it is what a change elsewhere failed to make.

So this is the missing sweep: for each artifact, does its entry exist?

    python verify/check_tree_consistency.py              # list every orphan
    python verify/check_tree_consistency.py --root PATH  # another tree
    python verify/check_tree_consistency.py --quiet      # counts only

What it deliberately does NOT check, and why:

  An entry without a note is not a violation. `notes/README.md` says notes are
  "requested for all new submissions" and literature baselines are exempt;
  roughly 170 entries have no note and that is allowed by design. Checking
  that direction would fail the board on a documented policy choice and
  pressure contributors to file filler. The pairing holds one way only: if a
  note exists, the entry it names must exist, because a note with no entry is
  unreadable by construction. The same one-way rule covers every other
  location below: this sweep never asks an entry to justify its artifacts, it
  asks an artifact to justify its entry.

  Content. Whether a note's [[n,k,d]] matches its filename, whether its
  citations resolve, and whether a certificate earns its level are
  `check_prose.py` and `check_certs.py`'s jobs; this checker only answers
  "does the entry it names exist", which is the question neither of them asks.
