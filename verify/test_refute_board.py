"""Tests for the weekly whole-board refutation driver (verify/refute_board.py).

SHARD  The K shards partition the board, every entry in exactly one, and the
       board is ordered largest n first so a binding budget drops small entries.
SEED   An entry's search seed depends on the run seed and its path only, so one
       run seed reproduces an entry's search from any shard or order.
BUDGET Once the wall-clock budget is spent no new entry is opened; the report
       lists the unreached entries and the verdict is a failure (issue #2896),
       never a quiet partial pass.
CLOSED A refuter error or a refutation fails the run, as before.
SUMMARY The cross-shard summary passes only when the expected number of reports
       are present and each is complete with nothing refuted or errored.

Run: uv run python verify/test_refute_board.py  (or pytest)
