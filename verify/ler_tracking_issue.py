"""Body of the tracking issue for failed and unverifiable LER replication points (issue #2820).

The weekly ler-weekly workflow re-measures every point of every measured-rate
claim (verify/ler_replicate.py) and writes receipts/ler/<slug>.json. A point
whose replica disagrees with the claim is recorded as failed, one the budget
could not check to the admissibility bound as unverifiable; the entry page
shows both and neither counts toward the frontier. This prints one issue body
listing those points, so a contradicted claim is visible without opening each
entry page. The workflow opens, edits, or closes the issue from the summary
line; this script reports and changes nothing.

A receipt whose claim digest no longer matches the entry (the claim was edited
after the measurement) or whose entry is gone reads as pending on the site and
is left out here too; the footer counts them.

Usage:
  python verify/ler_tracking_issue.py [--root DIR]            # body on stdout
  python verify/ler_tracking_issue.py [--root DIR] --out BODY  # body to a file,
