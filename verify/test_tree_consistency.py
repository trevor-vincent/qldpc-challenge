"""An artifact whose entry does not exist must fail, and only then.

The check exists because nothing used to ask the question: 38 notes and 21
certificates sat in the tree for entries that had been deleted, invisible to
`check_prose.py` (which only reads files a PR changes) and to `check_certs.py`
(which validates a certificate without asking whether its entry survives).

Everything here runs against a synthetic tree. The committed tree is the CI
step's business, not the suite's: `test_the_committed_tree_has_no_orphans`
used to sweep the repository too, so a contributor who had removed an entry
on a branch and not yet cleaned up after it got a second, unrelated-looking
failure for the same cause the dedicated step already reports (#946 -> #986:
mechanism tests take fixtures, they do not assert live board state).

The tests that matter most here are the ones about what is *not* a violation.
`notes/README.md` makes a note optional for an entry, so an entry with no note
is the documented state of roughly 170 codes and this checker must not touch
it; and the documentation files and the non-artifact files under `certs/` and
`receipts/ler/` are not artifacts of a code at all.
